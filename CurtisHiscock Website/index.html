    <h1>Hi, I'm Curtis</h1>
    <h2>Creative developer focused on AI, web, and game design</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a Computing Systems and Media Studies student at Trent University with a 
        minor in Cultural Studies. Over the course of my degree, I’ve grown as a 
        developer with a recent focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning 
        in Python, and web development. I’ll be graduating in April 2025 and am 
        looking for a role that challenges me while helping expand my skills. I love 
        building meaningful and creative tech – from more accessible web experiences 
        to engaging, interactive games.

          <p class="description">
            The Movie Mediator is a web-based movie recommendation tool I built to help users discover 
            films based on custom buzzwords or themes. I developed the backend by converting 
            my existing Python program into a web app using Flask — something completely new 
            to me. I also integrated a semantic search engine powered by natural language 
            embeddings and cosine similarity. The app features dynamic poster rendering, 
            reroll options for new suggestions, and a clean user interface. I'm currently 
            in the process of deploying the app using cPanel, with a focus on performance 
            optimization and maintaining a modular design. It's been a difficult, yet 
            rewarding project that I’m excited to see fully come to life.

          <p class="description">
            This assignment focused on JavaScript interactivity and DOM manipulation 
            across multiple tasks. I implemented a series of functional JavaScript features, 
            including dynamic array operations, real-time user interaction, event-based DOM 
            traversal, and integrating both local and external data using a public currency 
            conversion API. The project emphasized modular scripting, styling with CSS, and 
            writing clean, testable code.

          <p class="description">
            For this systems programming project, I developed a modular client-server application in C 
            called the Pokémon Property Server. The server loads and manages a dataset of Pokémon, 
            allowing clients to connect via TCP and query for specific properties such as type stats. 
            I implemented multithreading to ensure responsiveness during concurrent queries and background 
            file operations. The application was also structured with clean modular separation and compiled 
            using a Makefile for maintainability and scalability

          <p class="description">
            During my studies at Trent, I took several courses in game design and game studies. 
            It was during these courses that I created two original games from the ground up. 
            Each project required months of testing to ensure not only that the games ran 
            smoothly, but also that they were enjoyable and intuitive. Because these games 
            were also some of my first large solo projects, they demanded strong time 
            management skills to keep development on schedule
